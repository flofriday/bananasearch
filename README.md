# websearch

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)
Here is a screenshot with the word "dog" as a query on an index that was built
on 100 pages starting from [Wikipedia - Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)

This is just a simple project where I try to implement a web search engine like
Google.

At the moment you can crawl the web (inpolite) create an simple inverted index
and search for single words. However the results are not even ranked.
